 * Package with pax-logging specific classes supporting Avalon Framework Logging.
 *
 * There are no <em>factory methods</em> in Avalon as we know from SLF4J or Commons Logging. Simply an
 * implementation of {@link org.apache.avalon.framework.logger.Logger}.
 * {@link org.ops4j.pax.logging.avalon.AvalonLogFactory} is not a requirement from Avalon Framework itself.
