Pax Logging API

    Pax Logging has its own API, but it is not necessary to use it. 
    This {{{pax.html}page}} goes through the details.

Avalon Framework Logging API

    The Avalon Framework is used under the hood in many applications.
    Pax Logging supports this API, but only partially. See this
    {{{avalon.html}page}} for details.

Jakarta Commons Logging API

    The very commonly used Jakarta Commons Logging API is fully 
    supported, as is described {{{avalon.html}here}}

JDK java.util.logging API

    The JDK logging package is also fully supported, and how to use that
    can be found on its {{{jdk.html}page}}.

Log4J

    Log4J is a very popular tool and Pax Logging uses it as its backend.
    The Log4J API is not well defined, but we try to support it as well
    as possible. See the details {{{log4j.html}page}}.

SLF4J - Simple Logging Facade for Java

    SLF4J is fully supported, as described on this {{{slf4j.html}page}}.
